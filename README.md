# Spec Tool

This repository contains a single self-contained HTML page (`index.html`). The page runs entirely in the browser and does not require any build step or additional dependencies.

## Running the site

1. **Open the file directly**
   - Double-click `index.html` or open it from your browser's file menu.

2. **Or serve it locally**
   - From this directory, run:
     ```bash
     python3 -m http.server
     ```
   - Then visit [http://localhost:8000/index.html](http://localhost:8000/index.html) in your browser.

Either approach will load the interface.
